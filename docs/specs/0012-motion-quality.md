# Motion quality

> Make the launch videos look made by a top motion designer, not generated. The current videos read
> as AI-made for six reasons: flat look, fade-and-blur motion, system type, no brand assets, no sound,
> and no direction. Fix them in that order: research is in the craft rules and the renderer, assets
> come in through a tool, and direction comes from skill files the agent loads.

## Why

Spec 0011 phases 0–4 work end to end: from an address, the agent makes a 20–40 s motion video of the
real UI with clean lint. The user's verdict on the Supabase, Cardboard and Linear videos (2026-10-07):
"pretty basic… anybody can do these with Opus 5.5… nothing to wow about." Phases 5–7 (music, editing,
formats) wait until this is fixed.

Measured against the research below, the gap isn't the grammar's timing. It is everything around
it. A Reco frame today:
- **Flat look.** A solid near-black background with no light, no grain and no texture. Every
  pixel is 8-bit with no dither.
- **Template motion.**
  - Entrances are fade-ups and blur-ins, the first tell on everyone's list.
  - There is no motion blur, though spec 0011 promised a 180° shutter.
  - There are no masks other than the text reveals, and no velocity-matched cuts.
  - Every move eases out to rest the same way.
- **System type.** SF Pro, New York or SF Mono in four weights, with fixed tracking, whatever
  the brand.
- **No brand assets.** The logo is whatever element can be lifted from the page. The agent
  can't bring in a file: it has no download tool and no Write.
- **No sound.**
- **No direction.**
  - The playbook goes research → script → shots in one pass.
  - There is no arc, no chosen direction and no signature move.
  - There is no time-coded storyboard and no review by an independent eye.

## Expected outcome

- Three products (supabase.com, cardboard.ai, linear.app) made from their address alone:
  - **A blind side-by-side.** People shown one of these next to an official launch film of a
    comparable product (Linear Diffs, Ask Attio, Raycast) at phone size don't reliably pick
    which is ours (≤ 65% correct over 10 viewers).
  - **No two alike.** The three videos differ in palette, type, motion register and signature
    move.
- Every video carries:
  - the brand's real logo and typeface (or the closest open one);
  - a lit, textured background derived from the brand's colours;
  - masked reveals;
  - motion blur at speed peaks;
  - velocity-matched cuts;
  - one hero moment;
  - music and sound effects placed on the picture.
- The agent works like a studio: brief → arc → three directions, kill two → storyboard → build →
  critic → fix. The method lives in skill files the run loads, not in a growing prompt.
- Still true: the agent names what happens and the grammar does the motion (spec 0011, *Taste in
  the grammar*). Quality comes from a richer grammar and better direction, not from the agent
  writing keyframes.

## Research

From the background research of 2026-10-07: four parallel reports on craft, launch films,
other tools' skills and Reco's code. Tags:
- **[P]** a primary source states the number.
- **[S]** a secondary source.
- **[U]** practitioner norm, a starting value to tune by eye.

### What the admired films do

| Film | What makes it |
|---|---|
| Linear Agent, Linear Diffs (2026) | Masked type "out from behind invisible edges, no scaling or blurring", long holds, slow drift over dark UI, shallow depth of field in macro shots, a match cut from issue to diff [S impractical.ai] |
| Raycast "It's out", Cursor 2.0, Framer 3.0 | Hard cuts on the beat, punch-ins isolating one control, zoom-throughs *through* panels, "fast attack, long high-friction tail" [S] |
| Ask Attio, Dia | Typed query, 2.5D drift over layered dark UI, stark statements by masked reveal [S] |
| Figma Config 2025 (Relay) | Deliberately 15 fps for a handmade feel; a brand motion library with "expressive" and "functional" type [P figma.com blog] |
| Vercel Ship 2025 (basement) | Animated "on twos", EXR passes, graded in Resolve [P basement.studio] |
| Apple "Power to the Pro" (BUCK) | 250 frames, each a finished style frame before anything moved [P buck.co] |

Common to all of them:
- Real UI is the hero, with no abstract AI metaphors.
- Type does the narration; there is no voiceover.
- Easing is a fast attack with a long tail, and nothing bounces.
- Two editing modes: snappy (cuts on the beat, punch-ins) and calm (masked type, holds, drift).
  Spec 0011 measured the same split.

### The tells of AI motion (and the fix)

| Tell | Studio fix |
|---|---|
| Every element fades up 20–40 px and blurs in | Masks: text rises 100–110% of its line height from behind a hard edge, no opacity [U]; blur-in only with a 105–110% → 100% scale settle |
| One ease on everything, settling in ~20 frames | Registers per brand; premium settles take 30–33 frames at 30 fps, the last 5% of travel a third of the time [S launch-video-clone] |
| Lockstep groups, constant stagger | Eased stagger: the offsets shrink (×0.84 per item, HyperFrames waterfall) |
| Shots ease in from rest after a cut | Cut in already moving; the speed matches across the cut ("cut-the-curve": ±230 px on power4 either side ≈ 3,070 px/s) [S HyperFrames] |
| No motion blur; teleporting moves | 180° shutter; 270–360° or 40–80 px directional blur only in the middle frames of a whip [U] |
| Crossfades between busy UI | Hard cut, camera move or shared-element morph; crossfades ≤ 8 frames [U] |
| Flat #0B0B0F or purple-blue gradient | Brand-derived OKLCH field: 2–3 stops within 60° of hue, lightness spread ≤ 25, chroma under the accent, off-centre light, vignette 10–25% [U]; tint neutrals to the brand [S HyperFrames] |
| Banding | Grain at the threshold of notice ("if you notice it, halve it") [P instantgradient]; re-seeded at 12 Hz, not per frame (per-frame grain took the file from 9 to 85 MB) [S AbubakrChan] |
| Glow on everything, sheen spilling past corners | Bloom only on the top 5–10% of luminance, ≤ 2–3% of the frame height; one glint per shot, on the hero, clipped to its radius [S video-shotcraft Q4] |
| System or "safe" fonts | The brand's face (OFL or first-party), or its closest open match |
| Invented labels, generated logos | Real files only: the site's header SVG, `favicon.svg`, `apple-touch-icon`, press kit; never drawn [S launch-video-clone, 30x-video] |
| Constant shot lengths, slideshow (front-load then freeze), screensaver (everything drifting) | Long-short-short-long rhythm; reveals spread into the back half; one hero moment at 60–75% then 1–2 s of stillness [U] |
| Camera shake, whole-frame slam on every beat | No shake on UI; ≤ 3 whole-frame impacts per film, ≥ 16 beats apart [S video-shotcraft R4] |
| No self-review | A clean-context critic looks at frames with frame numbers [S video-shotcraft, EveryInc] |
| Same look for every brand | Three written directions, two killed, one signature move from a brand asset [S AbubakrChan] |

### Craft numbers

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Productive (UI beats) | cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0.38, 0.9) | IBM Carbon [P] |
| Expressive entrance (hero) | (0, 0, 0.3, 1) | Carbon [P] |
| Emphasized decelerate | (0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1) | Material 3 [P] |
| Exit | (0.4, 0.14, 1, 1); ~15% shorter than its entrance | Carbon [P], Material [P] |
| Spring bounce | 0 by default; 0.15 barely felt; ≤ 0.3 only for things arriving with momentum | WWDC23 [P] |
| Overshoot | 5–10% of travel, once, then settled; never on fades or text | [S], [U] |
| Anticipation | 2–4 frames, 2–5% of travel, once or twice per film | [U] |
| Follow-through | Content lands 1–3 frames after its container | [U], launch-video-clone measured ~1 frame |
| Stagger | 2–4 frames, eased, spread ≤ 40% of the move | Jitter [P], [U] |
| Shutter | 180°; whips 270–360° | AE default [P] |
| Whip pan | 10 frames, 5 either side of the cut, blur peaking at the cut | [S photofocus] |
| Zoom-through | Out 1→1.2, blur 10 px (text) / 18–20 (surfaces), 0.2 s power3.in; cut at peak; in from 0.75, expo.out 0.5 s; the inverse (0.8 / 1.25) for arrivals | HyperFrames cut catalog [S] |
| Line mask | 12–18 frames a line at 30 fps, lines 3–5 frames apart, no fade | [U] |
| Tracking breathe | +10–20% → 0 over 1–2 s, or +2–5% drift across a hold | [U] |
| Read text | ≥ 5.2% of frame height (56 px at 1080p); text is either read or texture, never between | video-shotcraft Q11 [S] |
| Reading rate | ≤ 17 characters/s, ≥ 20 frames per text | Netflix [P] |
| Parallax | Background 0.2–0.4×, hero 1×, foreground 1.3–2×; ≤ 3 planes | [U] |
| UI tilt | rotateX 10–25°, Y/Z ±5–15°; > 30° only while moving; dense information seen straight on | [U], video-shotcraft Q6 |
| Lifts | ≥ 2× the shown size; never past 1:1 without a sharper capture; depth of field never hides soft text | HyperFrames, video-shotcraft Q2 [S] |
| Grain | 2–6% luminance, monochrome, 1–1.5 px at 1080p | [U] |
| Chromatic aberration | ≤ 1–2 px at the corners, or only on whip frames; never uniform | [S], [U] |
| Beat | frames = 60 × fps / BPM; cut 1–2 frames before the transient | [S], [U] |
| SFX | whoosh peaks at the move's speed peak; alternate two samples, stepping down 0.40 → 0.25; compensate AAC priming (~1.3 frames at 30 fps) | video-shotcraft S1–S5 [S] |

Brand → motion register:
- **Precise or technical** (Linear, Vercel, Supabase):
  - expo/quint-out, 10–18 frames, no overshoot
  - cuts and push-throughs, mono typing
  - hairline grids, almost no grain, no glow
- **Premium or calm** (Apple, Stripe):
  - long tails, 20–36 frames, long holds
  - dolly with depth of field, match cuts, tracking-out type
  - soft fields, grain, one light sweep
- **Playful** (Notion, consumer):
  - spring bounce 0.2–0.35
  - pops from 80–90%, never from 0
  - brand-shape wipes, saturated palette
- **Bold** (launch hype):
  - expo in-out, whips of 8–10 frames with a long shutter
  - big type crops, cuts locked to the music

How studios derive the register:
1. Pick three adjectives.
2. Give each a speed, a curve, a shape vocabulary and a transition family.
3. Make a signature move from a brand asset: the logo's geometry as the wipe, the corner radius as
   the mask, the accent as the sweep.
4. Ban whatever contradicts the adjectives.

### How the best agent skills are organised

| Skill | Structure worth taking |
|---|---|
| HyperFrames `product-launch-video` (Apache-2.0) | Capture → design system → story (one arc: PAS, demo loop, before-after-bridge, feature-benefit cascade; each beat tagged with a persuasion move and an emotion) → time-coded shots → build → finalize. A `## Video direction` block written once (palette, motion grammar, holds, negative list); shots hold only deltas. Names both failure modes: *slideshow* and *screensaver* |
| video-shotcraft | Styleframe before storyboard. One technique per shot; each technique is the hero only once per film. Err slower ("every note said slow down"). A clean-context subagent reviews with frame numbers |
| launch-video-clone | Measures a reference film and grades the render against its curves. A logo source order. "Out of the box, Opus 5.5 makes the generic AI motion look" |
| AbubakrChan/product-launch-motion | "No house style: write three directions, kill two, keep a signature move"; the accent rationed on a written budget; re-render to a new file after each critique |
| EveryInc/product-launch-video | Four parallel critics (layout, readability, pacing, brand) on ~20 rendered frames |
| 30x-video | "Scrape first, design second"; an asset audit records every file as USE or SKIP before any shot uses it |

### Assets and licensing

- **Logo.** In order:
  1. inline SVG inside `header`/`nav`/`[role=banner]` (found structurally: class names caught 0
     of 32 on heygen.com);
  2. `favicon.svg`;
  3. `apple-touch-icon`;
  4. press kit;
  5. simple-icons (CC0 data, the trademark still the owner's).

  Two services are out:
  - Brandfetch's Logo API requires hotlinking and forbids downloading, so it can't feed a stored
    bundle.
  - Clearbit's API shut down on 2025-12-08.
- **Fonts.**
  - Google Fonts are OFL: fine to render into video, fetched from `github.com/google/fonts`.
  - A site's own `@font-face` file is usually web-licensed, and video needs another licence. So
    use it only when the user owns the brand (they say so in the bar), else the closest OFL face.
- **Images and video.** The site's own `og:image`, hero images and `<video>`s are first-party.
  Unsplash and Pexels require hotlinking plus attribution: out.
- **Icons.** Lucide (ISC), Phosphor (MIT).
- **Music and SFX.**
  - Pixabay bans commercial use of content showing trademarks, and some of its tracks raise
    Content ID claims.
  - Uppbeat's free tier excludes advertising.
  - Kenney SFX are CC0.

  So we bundle a small CC0 SFX set, take music from the user (a file) or a source whose licence
  covers ads, decided in the Q5 open question.

### Agent wiring (verified 2026-10-07)

- `--tools WebSearch,WebFetch` hides the Skill tool: a headless run with a skill in
  `AgentRun/.claude/skills` said "I don't have a Skill tool".
- With `--tools WebSearch,WebFetch,Skill,Read --allowedTools … Skill "Read(./.claude/skills/**)"`
  the same run used the skill and read a file next to it.
- `--setting-sources project` is meant to keep the user's own skills and settings out. The run
  listed only Claude Code's bundled skills besides ours; still to confirm with a personal skill
  present.
- The scoped Read limits reading to our skill files, so the run still can't read the user's disk.
- WebFetch can't save bytes. Downloading is a Reco MCP tool (`fetch_asset`) that writes into the
  bundle, not Bash or Write.

### What Reco can't express today (audit)

- **Fills.** No gradients anywhere (shape, text or background).
- **Shapes.** Only a filled rounded rectangle: no ellipse, path, stroke or SVG.
- **Compositing.** No masks or mattes between layers, no blend modes.
- **Effects.**
  - No bloom, grain, vignette, grade, light sweep or chromatic aberration.
  - No motion blur.
  - Shadows are black and fall straight down.
- **Type.**
  - No font files and no family field; four weights.
  - Tracking is fixed at −1.2% and isn't animatable.
  - No colour animation.
- **Moves.** No easing on moves: only hand keyframes take one. A spring has no bounce.
- **Assets and sound.**
  - No way for the agent to add a file.
  - No image or video layer besides lifted UI.
  - No audio.
- **Output.** 8-bit BGRA with no dither, so dark gradients will band.

## Approach

Six phases, ordered by what moves the verdict most per effort. Each ends with the three sites
re-run from their address and the frames compared with the previous round's (kept in
`~/Movies/Reco/quality/<phase>/`).

| Phase | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 - Assets: `fetch_asset`, logos, fonts, images | M | Todo |
| Q2 - Look: fields, light, grain, 10-bit | M | Fields picked; build todo |
| Q3 - Motion: reel, rhythm, camera, blur, masks, registers, seams | L | Todo |
| Q4 - Direction: skill files, storyboard, critic | M | Todo |
| Q5 - Sound: SFX and music on the picture | M | Todo (absorbs 0011 phase 5) |
| Q6 - New shots and the blind test | M | Todo |

**Order of work:**
1. The Q3 motion reel, so the user picks transitions and motion before any of it is built.
2. Q2 (the fields are picked).
3. Q3.
4. Q1 and Q4 together: the skills are text, and they name what Q2 and Q3 built.
5. Q5.
6. Q6.

**Progress log** (newest last; resume from the last line after a compact):
- 2026-10-07: started step 1, the motion reel (`docs/references/motion-reel/reel.html`).
- 2026-10-07: reel published: `claude.ai/artifact/FpneBQ15gRrmfMxJfzUUid`, source
  `docs/references/motion-reel/reel.html`.
  - 39 live frames: 12 transitions, 14 text reveals, 5 registers, 6 camera moves, 2 rhythms.
  - Each row pairs one of Reco's moves today, with its real timings from `MoveExpansion`,
    `SeamExpansion` and `ShotLayout`, against the proposal.
  - Checked headless at several times with no script errors.
  - Waiting for the user's picks; record them here.
- 2026-10-07: what today's videos do (read from the five `.motion` bundles in `~/Movies/Reco`).
  - Scenes run 2.5–4.5 s, except a feature sequence of 10–15 s.
  - Most seams are hard cuts. A zoom-through follows the hook; there is sometimes one cut on
    motion, and a fade into the end card.
  - Every shot drifts at 2% of the width a second, capped at 4% per scene, so 1% a second in a
    4 s scene.
  - Cut on motion carries only that drift speed, so it plays as a plain cut.
  - This is why "everything moves at the same speed": nothing in the grammar is ever fast. The
    seams already exist; what's missing is speed contrast, motion blur and masks.
  - Next: Q2 while the picks come in.
- 2026-10-07: the user's picks from the reel. They now define Q3's scope; see *Q3 - Motion*,
  *Picks*.
- 2026-10-07: Q2.1 (the four fields) done; see *Q2 - Look*, *Steps*. A real-content check
  showed the fields need placing around the type: next is Q2.1b, then Q2.2.
- 2026-10-07: the user rejected the Q2.1 result (`~/Movies/Reco/quality/Q2.1/`): the fields were
  ported and pasted behind the old video, "no progress at all". The four looks are a direction,
  not assets: find more work in that line and build animation of that quality. Q2.1b and the rest
  of Q2 are on hold. Next: links to the best launch films, grouped by direction, for the user to
  pick one; then rebuild the look against the picked films.
- 2026-10-07: 34 verified launch films in four directions given to the user:
  `docs/references/launch-films.md`. Waiting for their pick.
- 2026-10-07: the user picked **New Raycast**, **Nothing OS 5.0** and **3D UI layers**, and shared a
  guide to the "Opus 5.5 motion studio" method (reference → style guide → shot list → render →
  critique loop on its own frames), asking to use what helps but stay clear of the generated look.
  The four films were downloaded to `~/Movies/Reco/references/` and measured:
  `docs/references/style-guide.md` (cuts, camera speeds, levels, type, typing pace, and eleven tells
  of a generated video). Plan: *Direction (picked 2026-10-07)* below. Next: L1a.
- 2026-10-07: L1a–L1c built and checked against Raycast's frames; a 7.5 s Supabase shot (partner
  search typed "stripe", whip to the filtered card) is in `~/Movies/Reco/quality/L1/`
  (`raycast-vs-reco.mp4` side by side). What it took, beyond the satin field:
  - live mattes are the element's coverage: the translucent field's paint was only its placeholder's
    letters, so typed text showed through them alone (`MatteFill`);
  - the cursor hides from a typed key until it moves (`CursorPath`), the pointer rests once a clip
    types (`WebScript.pointerPosition`), and the renderer measures typed-into fields itself;
  - fields follow the camera at 15 % (`MotionFrameRenderer.fieldParallax`): pinned, the ground read
    as wallpaper behind the whip;
  - motion blur from a 180° shutter, the editor's sample rule (8 preview, 16 export).
  Critique against Raycast, worst first: the UI lacks its glass rim light and caret (WebKit's
  snapshots draw no caret); the satin's upper band is a broad even glow where Raycast's ground has
  distinct dark forms; the 3.7 s hold after the whip is dead; UI whites are full white (L1d);
  the results take baked at 7× is a 5684×6860 movie; card slots the filter empties show as dark
  boxes (the matte is the page as loaded). Next: L1d with the rim light, then L1e.
- 2026-10-07: the user's verdict on `raycast-vs-reco.mp4`: "really really bad". L1d and L1e are
  polish and wouldn't change that: no single frame of ours would pass next to a Raycast frame. The
  plan is changed: *Direction*, *Why L1 failed* and step **L0** below. What L1 built (satin,
  coverage mattes, the typing cursor rules, parallax, motion blur) stays; the shot itself is thrown
  away. Next: L0, stills only, shown to the user before anything moves.
- 2026-10-07: L0 for Raycast: two stills in `~/Movies/Reco/quality/L0/` (`ours-raycast-2.0s.png`,
  `ours-raycast-5.0s.png`, each stacked under its Raycast frame in `*-vs-ours.png`), waiting for the
  user's approval. Composited in numpy (`scratchpad/l0/still.py`, `specs.json`) from real lifts, every
  part something Core Image can draw, to port once approved:
  - **Content:** supabase.com/docs's ⌘K search, the same beat as Raycast's: empty (`Search docs...`,
    Inter 15 px, lifted at 14×, cap height 14 % of the frame, as Raycast's) and typed `auth` with
    its results, the first selected, green matches the only colour (8×, shown at 7.5×). Lifted
    alone with the dialog's own fill, border and shadow removed (it sits in a portal, so the page
    lab hid everything else itself: `UILiftScript.isolate` left the page behind it). Also surveyed:
    cardboard.ai's prompt box ("Describe your video, or drop footage…", presets under it) is the
    next candidate; linear.app's hero was still empty 1 s after load.
  - **Glass** (Raycast's pill and panel, measured at 4K): a band 0.08 × the cap height wide (12 px
    at 14×); ~41 where it faces down or right, ~82 facing left; a bright line on its outer edge where
    it faces up (+120 near the key, fading over ~half the frame's width), ~3 px deep; a thin
    highlight on its inner edge facing left. The body is dark (10–12) with the ground seen through it
    (45 % in linear light, blurred 40 px), a soft sheen band from the key (+26–38 at its top, fading
    over ~450 px) and a pool (+16). A soft shadow below.
  - **Ground:** satin as finite folds (a crest, a length, a width on each side, a smooth warp so
    no line is ruled), shaded by sheen, lit by pools, gaps to black, defocused 8–9 px; fitted block
    by block to Raycast's light map. For 5.0 s, a matte slab in focus over it with a chamfered edge
    as measured (a groove 11–13 px in at −30 %, the lit bevel, a 7 px falloff, a 1 px drop) and lit
    cloth beside it. Grain ~2 levels at 1080p in the mid-tones, none in black.
  - Raycast's typed text and caret are pure white (253–254); only its secondary text is grey.
  Critique, worst first: the UI is the real one, so it has Supabase's 8 px corners, plain magnifier
  and equal-sized title and description where Raycast's was designed for the film; the ground is
  fitted to these two frames, so whether it still reads as cloth when it drifts is untested (the
  footage-or-plate question stays open until then); B's satin is a little brighter than Raycast's.
  Next: the user's verdict on the stills; then port (satin folds and slab kernels, the glass
  compositor for lifted UI, a caret), then L1's motion again.
- 2026-10-07: the user moved on from the stills ("okay so animate now and a longer video"). A 24 s
  film in that look: `~/Movies/Reco/quality/L1/supabase-docs-film.mp4`, and
  `supabase-docs-film-vs-raycast.mp4` (Raycast's first 24 s above ours). A look-dev render in Python
  (`scratchpad/anim/film.py`, 720 frames in 51 s on 10 cores), not yet Reco's engine, from real
  lifts of every UI state (the page lab in `RecoTests/DebugShotTests.swift`):
  1. 0–3.2 s: satin alone, the empty search bar cut in at 1.0 s, the caret blinking, a slow drift.
  2. 3.2–7.6 s, wider: "row level security" typed at 7.4 characters a second, slower into each
     word; the results arrive after "row", "row level" and the end, a real result set each, the
     green matches growing with the query.
  3. 7.6–10.2 s, the results at 10×: down two, back up to the first (its page is the next shot),
     the camera following each hop 0.06 s late with motion blur.
  4. 10.2–15.0 s: that page, its H1 held at 5.4×, a 0.35 s whip (up to 96 blur samples) down to
     its `create policy` block on glass, a slow pan along the code.
  5. 15.0–24.0 s: Raycast's closing in the docs' own Source Code Pro caps: SUPABASE and a product
     swapped every 0.42 s, SUPABASE DOCS sliding together, BUILD IN A WEEKEND, the wordmark.
  Measured on Raycast's film for it: the bar cuts in at 1.0 s with no fade; its caret blinks ~0.53 s
  on and off with soft edges; results come with the first key; the closing swaps a word every
  0.33–0.5 s, slides the pair together over ~2 s, and ends on the logo alone. Captures: the typed
  prefixes are the input row lifted alone, laid over the settled result sets, so results change only
  where a search would have settled; selection is the real cmdk's ArrowDown; the dialog lives in a
  portal, so the lab hides everything but `[role=dialog]`. Critique, worst first: shot 4's code
  has no event (every Raycast shot has a UI state change; a copy turning into a check would, but the
  first button found was word wrap); the results panel opens within two frames, a pop rather than
  an expansion (Raycast's pops too); no sound; the encode keeps part of the grain (44–51 dB against
  the frames). Next: the user's verdict, then the port into the engine (satin folds and slab, the
  glass compositor, the caret and typing pace, lifting UI that only exists after a click, the
  word-swap closing) so Reco makes this from an address.
- 2026-10-07: the user's verdict on the film: "this one was good" (a copy is on their Desktop).
  The look and grammar are approved. Next: the port into the engine, phase by phase, each checked
  against this film's frames.

### Direction (picked 2026-10-07)

Today's Linear video against Linear Agent (`scratchpad/refs/today`): ours shows the whole app at
0.6 % text height, unreadable, still, on flat black, under a centred caption. The films crop to one
control (text 2.5–4 % of the height), something real happens in it (typing, a menu, a result
streaming in), it's lit, and the camera holds then moves with intent. So the lever is the shot,
not the background; the fields of Q2.1 stay as one ingredient.

**Why L1 failed** (its frames against Raycast's at the same moments, worst first):
1. **Animated before a still matched.** Motion was built on frames that were wrong at rest. The
   article's own gate (stills → animatic → full pass) was skipped.
2. **UI as a screenshot, not a material.** Raycast's pill is glass: the satin shows blurred through
   its fill, a rim of light runs round its outline (brighter at the top left), a soft shadow under
   it. Ours is the page's element as WebKit paints it: an opaque flat field with a grey hairline.
3. **Too small.** Raycast's focal text is ~17 % of the frame's height, one control filling 60 % of
   the width. Ours was ~7 %, so it reads as a page, not a hero object.
4. **The ground reads as CG.** The satin is a smooth procedural gradient; Raycast's ground has real
   fold forms, highlights with shape, and texture. A shader may not get there: footage or a
   rendered plate may be needed (licensing is the user's call).
5. **No choreography.** Raycast chains UI states in one take (typed → results → menu → hotkey →
   saved) with the camera following; ours was two unrelated beats and a dead 3.7 s hold.
6. **Content.** Supabase's partner page offers a plain search box and cards. Each product needs its
   most cinematic real interaction found first (prompt boxes, command menus, toggles, dashboards).
7. Small: no caret (WebKit snapshots draw none), machine-even typing, full-white UI type.

Built and checked one at a time against the films' frames, side by side, with a scored critique
(hook, readability at phone size, motion, composition, brand, the eleven tells) until each scores 8.
0. **L0 Look-dev gate: stills before motion.** For each direction, two stills of ours at
   1920×1080, each next to the reference frame it answers, until they could pass in the same film.
   The user approves the stills before any animation is built for that direction. For Raycast, the
   frames at 2.0 s (the search pill in macro over satin) and 5.0 s (typed, results below). What
   the stills need, built only as far as a still shows it:
   - **glass for lifted UI:** the element lifted without its fill, the ground under its coverage
     blurred and tinted through it, a rim light along its outline from the matte's edge, a soft
     shadow, so a real control reads as a lit object;
   - **hero scale:** one control at 12–20 % text height, with shallow depth of field from a slight tilt;
   - **a better ground:** first a richer satin (shaped highlights, fold detail); if it still reads as
     CG, ask the user about footage or a rendered plate;
   - **the right content:** for each of supabase.com, linear.app, cardboard.ai, the one or two real
     interactions worth a macro shot, found with `inspect_page` before any shot is designed;
   - a caret and the low-key grade (old L1d), once the rest passes.
1. **L1 Raycast — dark satin.** The parts built so far are kept; the shot is redone after L0.
   - **Done:** L1a `satin` field: black satin folds under one slow, broad key light, out of focus,
     monochrome; levels as measured (median 11–25, crests to ~45 %).
   - **Done:** L1b a macro live shot: a real input typed into, shown at 2.5–3× and cut off by the
     frame edge; built by hand as a document, rendered through the plan, compared with Raycast's
     1–5 s. Still to do: a human pace (8–15 characters a second with pauses; takes type an even
     12.5) and depth of field (the plane was flat).
   - **Done:** L1c hold and whip: the camera holds, then moves to the next element in 0.25–0.4 s
     with motion blur from sub-frame samples (the editor's way).
   - L1d low-key grade: UI whites at 70–75 %, blacks at 0, dither.
   - L1e the closing: tiny mono caps on black, a word swapped every 0.5 s, a pair closing up, the logo.
2. **L2 Nothing — dot screen and callouts:** a gradient under a fixed dot screen (pitch 0.83 % of the
   width, dot 0.1 %); a dot-matrix title with a scramble reveal; callouts with a crosshair and a
   leader line to a real element, named in mono caps; the inline-icon lockup.
3. **L3 3D layers:** a UI exploded isometrically into its parts (each a lift), separating in depth
   and settling; Linear's single plane in the dark, lit by a falling-off pool of light, text streaming
   in line by line.
4. **L4 into the grammar and the agent:** the shots and moves L1–L3 proved, named; the eleven tells as
   lint and design checks; the critique loop in the agent's playbook.

### Q1 - Assets (M)

- **`fetch_asset(bundle, url, kind)`**, an MCP tool. `kind` is logo, font, image or video. It
  downloads into `assets/fetched/` and replies with the stored path, size, format and the
  licence note it applied.
  - Only `https`. ≤ 50 MB. One redirect chain, no `file:`.
  - Content sniffed, so the extension can't lie.
  - Fonts only from `fonts.gstatic.com` / `github.com/google/fonts`, or the product's own site
    when the brand is the user's.
- **`inspect_page` → `brand`** gains `logos` (structural header/nav SVGs, ranked favicons,
  `apple-touch-icon`, `og:image`), `fonts` (the computed families of the headline and body, their
  `@font-face` sources) and `media` (hero `<video>` and image sources). The agent fetches from
  this list, not from a search.
- **SVG** is drawn by WebKit at the scale shown (the lift path: one page, snapshot with alpha), so
  logos stay sharp at any zoom.
- **Fonts.** `TextContent.font` names a font asset. It is registered for the process with
  `CTFontManagerRegisterFontURLs` (`.process` scope) when a plan is built. The face falls back to
  `face` if it fails.
  - Weights 100–900.
  - Tracking and line height become fields.
- **Image and video layers.** An image layer takes any fetched file. A `video` layer plays a
  fetched clip, muted, on the scene's clock: the live-take track, without a page.
- **Asset audit.** `edit_motion` lists every asset with whether a scene uses it. The skill makes
  the agent record USE or SKIP with a reason before writing scenes.
- **Done when:** the three sites' end cards carry their real logos (SVG for Supabase and Linear),
  their headlines are set in the brand face or its named OFL substitute, and no file outside the
  bundle was written.

### Q2 - Look (M)

- **Steps.** Built and verified one at a time; each ends with the tests passing and lint clean.
  1. **Q2.1 Fields: done (2026-10-07).**
     - `canvas.field` and `scene.field` (`ember`, `matrix`, `halo`, `sunlit`, `plain`).
     - `set_canvas` and `set_scene` take it; `edit_motion`'s reply gives each scene's field.
     - The Scene inspector has a Field picker.
     - `FieldPalette` derives the colours from `style.accent` (see *Built* below).
     - Each scene draws its own field under its layers, on the video's clock.
  2. **Q2.1b Field placement (next).** A real check (a copy of the Supabase video with `matrix`,
     and `halo` on its end card, rendered through the plan;
     `scratchpad/supabase-fields.png`) drew right, but composed badly:
     - matrix's lit sphere sits dead centre, right behind the hook's and title's centred headlines,
       so the type reads busy;
     - halo's smoke covers the end card's name. The tile picked had the logo inside the ring and
       the name below it.

     To build:
     - the end card on `halo`: the logo inside the ring, the name and detail below it, as picked;
     - a field's lit mass kept off the text: the sphere moves to a side when the shot's text is
       centred;
     - a design check for text whose contrast against the field under it falls below 4.5:1.
  3. **Q2.2 Grain and vignette:** a whole-frame pass after everything, so grain sits on the UI too.
  4. **Q2.3 Grade and bloom.**
  5. **Q2.4 Half-float frames, dither to 8-bit, 10-bit HEVC and ProRes,** and the banding check.
  6. **Q2.5 Light:** coloured, offset shadows; rim; the `sweep` move.
  7. **Q2.6 Gradient fills** on shapes and text, and the gradient-headline lint.
- **Built (Q2.1).**
  - **Kernels.** `Reco/Motion/Render/FieldKernels.metal.txt` holds the GLSL ported to Core Image
    stitchable kernels; `FieldRenderer` draws them.
    - They're compiled at run time by the system's Metal compiler, about 8 ms once. Xcode 26
      builds `.metal` files only with a separately downloaded Metal Toolchain, which every builder
      and CI would need.
    - Each kernel is compiled alone. Compiled together, Core Image drew only whichever sampling
      kernel it drew first; the other came out transparent (macOS 26.5).
  - **Fidelity.** Each look is drawn as the 1280×720 gallery tile it was picked on, at a pixel
    ratio of 2, scaled to the frame.
    - Against Paper Shaders' WebGL at u_time 4 and 1280×720: ember 50.8 dB, matrix 72.0, halo
      64.8, sunlit 56.3, with mean differences of at most 0.15 code values.
    - The grain gradient's `fwidth` is taken as a GPU does, to the other pixel of the 2×2 quad.
      Forward differences everywhere gave 27–33 dB: the same grain, different speckles.
  - **Colours.** Each stop keeps its picked OKLCH lightness and its hue offset from the lead. The
    lead takes the brand's hue, and its chroma up to the picked one's. A brand with chroma under
    0.03 gets cool greys.
  - **Cost** (M5, Debug, p50):

    | Field | 1080p whole | 1080p preview | 4K export |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | ember | 2.7–4.1 ms | 1.5 ms | 9.8 ms |
    | halo | 3.0 ms | 1.6 ms | 11.1 ms |
    | sunlit | 2.6 ms | 1.4 ms | 9.7 ms |
    | matrix | 0.35 ms | 0.3 ms | 0.65 ms |

    The preview (`MotionPlan.isPreview`) draws the soft looks at most at 720p and scales them up;
    exports draw them whole, for crisp grain. Matrix is always drawn whole.
  - **Push seam.** A push now moves whole frames, each with its own field. Before, a scene's UI
    wider than the frame showed through the incoming scene's empty background (golden
    `motion-grammar-12100` redrawn).
- **Fields picked (2026-10-07).** Source, settings and porting notes: `docs/references/paper-shaders/`. Picked from a live gallery of 12 (`gallery.html` there), these
  [Paper Shaders](https://github.com/paper-design/shaders) 0.0.81 looks (Apache-2.0: keep its NOTICE in
  the app's acknowledgements), ported from their GLSL to Metal kernels for Core Image:

  | Field | Shader and settings | Use |
  |---|---|---|
  | `ember` | grain gradient, corners; three shades of the brand hue on #050405; softness 0.6, intensity 0.35, noise 0.3, speed 0.4 | Bold brands; type in the dark gap |
  | `matrix` | dithering, sphere, 4×4 ordered, 2 px; the brand hue on near-black; speed 0.35 | Technical brands (databases, APIs, dev tools) |
  | `halo` | smoke ring; white and the brand hue on black; radius 0.3, thickness 0.65, noise 3 × 8, speed 0.3 | The end card's logo moment |
  | `sunlit` | grain gradient, wave; three warm tones of the brand on a dark ground; softness 0.7, intensity 0.15, noise 0.5, speed 0.35 | Calm or playful title cards |

  Not picked: ink mesh, light from above, neural glow, dot grid, peach swirl, light paper mesh.
  Frames are deterministic (`time = frame / fps`), so preview and export match; the shader's own
  noise texture goes into the app as a resource.
- **Background field.** `canvas.background` can be a field instead of a colour:
  - 2–4 colour points, interpolated in OKLab, drifting ≤ 5% of the frame per 10 s;
  - a light (position, radius, intensity) and a vignette.
  - Derived from `brand` by rule: neutrals tinted toward the brand hue, chroma under the
    accent, lightness spread ≤ 25. The agent picks a field by name (`ember`, `matrix`, `halo`,
    `sunlit`, or a plain colour), never numbers.
- **Gradient fills** on shapes and text (linear, radial). Lint flags gradient text in a headline:
  a tell.
- **Light.**
  - Shadows get colour and an x offset.
  - A `rim` light on a UI plane: a thin edge highlight that follows its tilt.
  - A `sweep` move: one specular band crossing a layer once, clipped to its shape, additive
    ≤ 40%. Lint: one sweep per scene, three per film.
- **Bloom.** Thresholded at the top ~8% of luminance, radius ≤ 2.5% of the height, on the
  whole frame.
- **Grade.** One per document: lifted blacks, a slight tint toward the brand, saturation held
  under the accent.
- **Grain.** Monochrome, about 4%, re-seeded at 12 Hz, applied after the grade.
- **Pipeline.**
  - Frames drawn in half-float (the HDR compositor's path).
  - Dithered to 8-bit for H.264.
  - 10-bit for HEVC and ProRes, so dark fields don't band.
- **Design check** adds banding (steps wider than 4 px in a smooth field) and bloom clipping.
- **Done when:**
  - The three sites' frames show no banding at 4K H.264 and 1080p HEVC (measured: no luma step
    over 1 code value across 8 px in the field).
  - Mean luma stays in the measured 12–24 band.
  - A 4K frame with field, bloom, grade and grain renders within the 8 ms preview budget at
    display size (exports may take longer).

### Q3 - Motion (L)

- **Picks (2026-10-07).** Picked from the motion reel (`docs/references/motion-reel/reel.html`,
  the ids below are its frames'). Q3 builds these and only these; where a bullet below names
  something not picked, the picks win.
  - **Seams:**
    - `morph`: shared element; the card flies, grows and straightens into the next shot's panel;
      0.65 s on (0.2, 0, 0, 1); the panel's rows follow 2 frames apart, ×0.84.
    - `inverseZoomThrough`: out 1 → 0.8 power3.in 0.2 s, in 1.25 → 1 expo.out 0.5 s, blur 10 px.
    - `matchCut`: the camera dives 4× into a named layer and comes out of the next scene's at the
      same place and size; speeds matched across the cut.
    - `shapeWipe`: the next scene grows from a rounded square with the brand's corner radius,
      expo.in-out 0.8 s, settling from 108%.
  - **Text:**
    - `blurWipe` stays the default headline reveal for sans faces. Mask rise is not adopted.
    - `type` gets a human pace (55 ms ± 25 ms a key) and a caret that blinks at rest.
    - `roll` becomes masked: in from below, out above, no fade, every 0.75 s.
  - **Camera:** `punchIn`: to 3.2× on one control in 0.32 s expo.in-out, creeping 4%, then a hard
    cut back wide.
  - **Rhythm:** both picked. Today's even pacing and the energy curve are both offered;
    the brand or the storyboard chooses between them, so the energy curve is not forced on every
    video.
  - **Not picked:**
    - seams: cut the curve, whip, masked push, nor today's crossfade, blur cut, push, zoom-through
      or cut on motion;
    - text: mask rise, per character, masked word by word, rise and settle, tracking breathe;
    - camera: parallax truck, push with orbit, rack focus, nor today's drift or push;
    - registers: none of the four.

    Today's unpicked moves stay in the grammar until replaced; the new ones above are what Q3
    adds.
  - **Open:** were the registers rejected, or just not chosen yet? Until the user says, Q3 doesn't
    build `style.motion`.
- **Motion reel first.** Done (see the progress log). Before building, a live gallery like the backgrounds' one (HTML and
  WebGL, the same UI card and headline in every frame), so the user picks by eye. Picks are
  recorded here, with their source saved in `docs/references/`.
  - **Transitions:** cut-the-curve, whip, zoom-through and its inverse, match cut, shape wipe in
    the brand radius, mask reveal, plus today's fade and blur cut for comparison.
  - **Text reveals:** maskRise, per-character, tracking breathe, scale settle, typing, roll,
    against today's blur-in.
  - **Registers:** the same 6 s shot played precise, calm, playful and bold.
  - **Camera:** drift, push, orbit with parallax, rack focus, punch-in.
  - **Rhythm:** one 15 s sequence paced flat, as today, against paced with an energy curve.
- **Rhythm.** Today every move and scene runs at about the same speed, so nothing lands.
  - The storyboard gives each beat an energy level from 1 to 5, along a curve:
    1. a calm open;
    2. rising through the features;
    3. the hero at 60–75%, fastest and biggest;
    4. 1–2 s of stillness;
    5. a calm end card.
  - Energy sets the scene's length, its moves' speed (duration scale 0.6–1.5×), its seam (cuts
    and whips when high, match cuts and drifts when low) and whether the camera moves.
  - Moves inside a shot contrast too:
    - a fast attack with a long tail;
    - one element fast and the rest following;
    - holds where nothing moves.
  - Lint: the fastest beat must be at least 3× the slowest in move speed, as scene length
    already is.
- **Camera.** It moves for a reason and carries energy between shots.
  - Up to 3 planes at parallax 0.3×, 1× and 1.5×.
  - An orbit of 3–8° yaw while pushing, never a pure straight push.
  - A rack focus over 12–20 frames.
  - A punch-in to one control.
  - Velocity carried across cuts.
  - No shake on UI.
- **Motion blur.**
  - 180° shutter per layer and camera, sampled across the shutter as the editor does
    (`blurOffsets`): 8 samples in the preview, 16 in export.
  - Only frames with speed get sampled, so still frames cost nothing.
  - Whip seams use 300°.
- **Masks.**
  - A layer can be masked by another layer's shape or alpha (`matte: <layer id>`,
    alpha or inverted).
  - A group can clip its children to its bounds.
  - From these come the reveals:
    - `maskRise`: text or UI rising from behind an edge, no fade. It becomes the default
      headline reveal for sans faces, replacing `blurWipe` as the default.
    - `shapeWipe`: the brand's corner radius growing to reveal the next layer.
    - Type through a UI card.
- **Registers.**
  - `style.motion` is `precise | calm | playful | bold`, set from the brand, never per move.
  - It picks:
    - the enter, exit and move curves (the Carbon and Material values above);
    - the duration scale;
    - the stagger curve;
    - whether a single overshoot is allowed on arrivals with momentum (`playful`, `bold`
      only, bounce ≤ 0.3).
  - Moves keep their names. Their timings come from the register, so two brands don't move
    alike.
- **Settles and staggers.**
  - Scale settles in log-quartic over 30–33 frames at 30 fps (`calm`, `precise`), 18–24
    (`bold`).
  - Staggers shrink ×0.84 per item.
  - Containers lead their content by 1–2 frames (follow-through).
- **Seams.**
  - `cutOnMotion` becomes "cut-the-curve": the outgoing shot accelerates on power4.in and the
    incoming one starts at the same speed and direction.
  - `whip`: 10 frames, a long shutter at the cut.
  - `inverseZoomThrough` for arrivals.
  - `matchCut`: the next scene's named layer starts where the previous scene's named layer
    ended, in position and scale.
  - `fade` is limited to 8 frames between UI scenes.
- **Type moves.**
  - `track` (tracking from +15% to 0, or a slow +3% drift through a hold).
  - `settle` (from 108% with a mask).
  - `weight` (variable axis, for fonts that have one).
  - `crop`: a huge word at 2–4× the frame width, panning slowly, used as texture.
- **Lint additions:**
  - every element entering within 2 frames of another;
  - all shots the same length (±15%);
  - an overshoot outside `playful`/`bold`;
  - a fade between UI scenes > 8 frames;
  - text shown under chars/17 + 0.5 s or under 20 frames;
  - more than one sweep per scene;
  - no hold of ≥ 1 s after the hero;
  - a scene whose reveals all fall in its first quarter (slideshow);
  - every layer drifting (screensaver).
- **Done when:**
  - A frame-by-frame measurement of the rebuilt Linear Agent recreation (spec 0011 phase 0)
    matches the reference's move curve with correlation ≥ 0.95, the launch-video-clone test.
  - The cut speed across seams matches within 10%.
  - Golden frames cover each new seam and reveal.

### Q4 - Direction (M)

- **Skills.** Shipped in the app (`Reco/AgentRecording/Skills/`) and copied into
  `AgentRun/.claude/skills/` before each run, like `reco-mcp.json`. The run gets
  `--tools WebSearch,WebFetch,Skill,Read`, `--allowedTools … Skill "Read(./.claude/skills/**)"`
  and `--setting-sources project`.

  | Skill | What it holds |
  |---|---|
  | `launch-director` | The method: brief and one promise → pick one arc (PAS, demo loop, before-after-bridge, feature-benefit cascade) → beats with a persuasion move and an emotion → three directions in a sentence each, kill two, keep a signature move → `## Video direction` block (palette, register, type, holds, negative list) → time-coded storyboard → build with `edit_motion` → critic → fix once → export |
  | `motion-craft` | The craft numbers and tells above, as rules with reasons; which reveal, seam and shot fits which beat; err slower |
  | `brand-motion` | Attributes → register, field preset, type treatment and signature move; worked examples for a technical, a calm and a playful brand |
  | `brand-assets` | Where logos, fonts and media come from, in order; the licence rules; the USE/SKIP audit |
  | `critic` | How to read a contact sheet: frame-numbered findings against the tells list, legibility (5.2% height), one hero, rhythm, brand fit. Run as a second, clean-context `claude -p` by Reco after the first preview: it sees only the sheet, the storyboard and the skill, and returns findings the first run then fixes |

- **Playbook.** The launch playbook shrinks to pointing at `launch-director`. `edit_motion`'s
  description keeps the grammar reference.
- **Storyboard.** The run writes it into the bundle (`storyboard.md`, through `edit_motion`'s
  new `set_notes`). It shows in the chat, so a person sees the plan the video was built from.
- **Done when:**
  - Each of the three runs leaves a storyboard with an arc, three directions and a signature
    move, and a critic pass whose findings were fixed.
  - The three videos differ in register and field preset.
  - Run time stays under 8 minutes.

### Q5 - Sound (M)

- **SFX.** A bundled CC0 set (Kenney, about 40 files: whooshes, ticks, impacts, risers, keys),
  placed by rule:
  - whooshes peak at a move's speed peak;
  - clicks land on the press frame;
  - typing gets keys;
  - repeats alternate between two samples and step down in volume;
  - AAC priming is compensated.
- **Music.** A file the user drops in, or none. Spec 0011 phase 5's onset and beat tracking moves
  here. Snapping seams 1–2 frames before beats is per document.
- **Mix.** Loudness to −14 LUFS integrated.
- **Done when:** sounds land within 1 frame of their events in the exported file (measured), and
  the mix measures −14 ± 1 LUFS.

### Q6 - New shots and the blind test (M)

- **New shots:**
  - `punchIn`: one control at 3–6×, lifted at that scale, depth of field on the rest.
  - `heroReveal`: the 60–75% moment; a full action arc of spotlight → push → rim light →
    settle, then stillness.
  - `bigType`: a statement set huge, masked, cropped.
  - `stat`: a counter that counts.
  - `finale`: earlier elements land in place around the wordmark.
- **The blind test** from *Expected outcome*, with the scores recorded here.

## Risks

- **More knobs, more ways to look generated.** The register, field presets and lint keep choices
  few. The agent never sets a curve or a colour stop.
- **Render time.** Motion blur, bloom and grain are per frame. The preview may drop to half
  resolution during playback; exports are offline.
- **Licences.** Fonts and logos follow the rules above. When in doubt, use the OFL substitute and
  the site's own files.
- **Critic cost.** A second run adds about 1 minute. It is skipped on chat edits.

## Open questions

1. Music: user file only, or a licensed library through an API (Artlist, Epidemic) at the
   user's cost?
2. Should the bar ask "is this your brand?" so the site's own font and media can be used directly?
3. Animating on twos (12 fps characters over 24/60 fps camera), as Config and Vercel did: a
   `cadence` per register, or not at all?
